## Overview

kbindake turns your Makefile into a **supercharged hotkey manager**. kbindake allows to map key combos into makefile commands, and see the output in a convenient overlay.

## Features ‚ú®

- üéØ **Makefile-based configuration** - Reuse your existing makefile scripts.
- üöÄ **Global hotkeys** - Works system-wide, allows to switch between programs efficiently with a keybinding.
- üé® **Visual overlay** - See command output in beautiful on-screen displays.
- ‚ö° **Autoboot commands** - Run stuff automatically when kbindake starts.
- üîß **Help binding viewer** - See all your shortcuts with a special hotkey.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martinlevesque/kbindake
cd kbindake
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Create a Makefile** in `~/.config/kbindake/Makefile`:

```makefile
# kbindake[autoboot,overlay-command-output]: <Super>+<Ctrl>+f
firefox:
	firefox &
```

This sample Makefile will boot a new instance of firefox when hitting Super+Ctrl+F. Note that, to make it resumable and avoid booting a new firefox process everytime, you can reuse it with a command such as (example in Linux):

```makefile
# kbindake[autoboot,overlay-command-output]: <Super>+<Ctrl>+f
firefox:
	if pgrep -x firefox-bin > /dev/null; then \
		wmctrl -xa firefox; \
	else \
		firefox & \
	fi; \
	echo "Firefox Browser"
```

The overlay-command-ouput specifies that the stdout output is displayed in the UI overlay, in this example it will be display "Firefox Browser".
See an example in `Makefile.sample`.

2. **Run kbindake manually for testing**:

```bash
python kbindake/main.py -v
```

3. **Make it autoboot**

Add the command line into your favorite startup application manager (e.g. Startup Applications Preferences in Ubuntu):

```
python <kbindake folder>/kbindake/main.py --boot-wait 30 --bindings-overlay-hotkey "<Super>+h"
```

The `--boot-wait` option is recommended such that the graphical interface has been initialized at boot time.

## Hotkey Format üìù

- Use `+` to combine keys: `<ctrl>+<alt>+t`
- Special keys: `<super>`, `<ctrl>`, `<alt>`, `<shift>`
- Letters and numbers: `a-z`, `0-9`
- Function keys: `<f1>`, `<f2>`, etc.
- Arrow keys: `<up>`, `<down>`, `<left>`, `<right>`

## Implementation structure

kbindake is built with a simple, modular architecture:

- **`kbindake/keyboard.py`** - Global hotkey detection using `pynput`.
- **`kbindake/makefile_config.py`** - Parses your Makefile and executes commands.
- **`kbindake/printer_view.py`** - Overlay UI component with dynamic sizing.
- **`kbindake/__init__.py`** - Glue the 3 main modules together.

## Alternative Solutions

kbindake was inspired by these awesome tools:

- [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) - Simple X hotkey daemon
- **xbindkeys** - Classic X11 key binding utility
